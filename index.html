        <p>As a new student, the transition to college can be overwhelming. It is critical to build a foundation for success during your first year of college. Let us help you with the process as you begin your journey here at Rock Valley College. To apply for admissions, apply online or pick up a paper form at the Information Center on the first floor of the Student Center on RVC's Main Campus. Once admitted, you have the option to apply for financial aid. Did you know half of RVC's students receive some sort of financial assistance (grants, scholarships, loans, or student employment)? We can help you fund your education.<br><br>
            
        All new students must meet placement requirements in reading, English and math. You can do that by taking our placement test or by submitting ACT or SAT scores or prior college transcripts if you have them. You will also meet with a helpful academic advisor to help make sure you are taking the right classes to meet your academic goals. Once you meet with your advisor, all you need to do is go online and sign up for your classes!<br><br>
            
        Multiple offices are available on our main campus for assistance. You can find their locations, phone numbers, and hours below:
